                The Panda bear is a large mammal native to central China. Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous
                regions. These high bamboo forests are cool and wet—just as pandas like it.Giant pandas have a
                distinctive black and white coat, with black fur around their eyes and on their
                ears, muzzle, legs and shoulders. Their thick, wooly coat helps to keep them warm in their cool mountain
                homes.Adult pandas are about 150cm from nose to rump, with a 10-15cm tail. And they can grow up to 90cm
                tall
                at the shoulder.An adult panda can weigh up to 150kg, with males 10% larger and 20% heavier than
                females.
                Everyone knows that pandas eat bamboo. A typical animal eats half the day—a full 12 out of every 24
                hours.In fact, in a single day, a panda can eat between 20 and 30 pounds of bamboo!

            <p>Pandas have been an important part of Chinese culture for centuries. These bears were always regarded as
                noble creatures, and were even given to other countries as peace offerings. A number of different
                emperors and empresses have had pandas as pets, or held them in private zoos.
                Giant pandas are solitary. They have a highly developed sense of smell that males use to avoid each
                other and to find females for mating in the spring. After a five-month pregnancy, females give birth to
                a cub or two, though they cannot care for both twins. They are born white, and develop their much loved
                coloring later.</p>
